# Db2 & Pacemaker cluster manager

The combination of Pacemaker and HADR enables high availability and disaster recovery for DB2 databases. It is currently supported for Db2 HADR clusters on Linux for on-prem deployments and is installed manually on top of Db2.  Pacemaker is planned to become the future cluster solution for all types of Db2 deployments including pureScale, DPF, and containerized Db2 deployments in the cloud.
